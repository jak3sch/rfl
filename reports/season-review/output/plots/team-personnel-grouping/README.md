## Visualization of the used fantasy football lineup variations between 2016 and 2022

Since the launch of the Rocketbeans Football League (RFL) in 2016, numerous matchups have been played. The lineup rules call for 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 PK and 2 flex spots for the offense. For the defense, 2 DL (DT and DE), 2 LB, and 2 DB (CB and S) positions are required, as well as 3 flex spots.

These requirements provide ample room for individual decisions, which I wanted to visualize. The result will be part of the comprehensive league report for last season.
