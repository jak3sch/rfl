# RFL Postseason Appearances

Recently I came across this [beautiful chart](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3310-a-history-of-the-fifa-world-cup) and thought, it would be a great inspirataion for my fantasy football league report.

## Visualization of each teams appearances in the RFL postseason between 2016 and 2022
