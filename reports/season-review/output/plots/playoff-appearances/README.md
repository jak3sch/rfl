# RFL Postseason Participations

Recently I came across this [beautiful chart](https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/3310-a-history-of-the-fifa-world-cup) and thought, it would be a great inspirataion for my fantasy football league report.

## Visualization of each teams participation in the RFL postseason between 2016 and 2022

The Rocketbeans Football League (RFL) consists of 36 teams playing in two conferences with three divisions each.

The 3 division winners and the three next best teams play in the Superbowl for the league title, while the next best 12 teams play in the Probowl and the 12 worst teams play in the Toiletbowl for the honor.
