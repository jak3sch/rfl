## average team weekly score ----
## 1. adding the individual scores of all nine starting positions together
## 2. we'll use the average points from the top-12 (24 for RB and WR) highest-percentage started players of each week
## 3. The process is the same for flex as a single starting position, except that all players considered a starter in their native position (RB, WR, TE) are not eligible for flex, as it's presumed these players already occupy a starting spot somewhere in the league. However, the next top-12 most-started combination of RB, WR, and TE for each week do qualify.
## 4. Simply adding all nine positional averages from this process together produces the expected amount of points the average team in a 12-team half-point PPR league for any given week.

## replacement player ----
## The idea of a replacement player is that if you have a starting player miss a game due to injury, suspension, bye, etc., you are forced to insert your next best option into your starting lineup.
## This would either be someone on your bench or from the waiver wire/free agent pool.
